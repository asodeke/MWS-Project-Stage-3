Stage 3 of google mobile web development

## Project Overview Stage 3

**Restaurant Reviews** projects, this started with a static unresponsive webpage then converting it to a accessible & responsive mobile-friendly web application.
In **Stage One**, the webpage was redesigned to be responsive to different screen displays while aslo making it usable for screen readers by adding **ARIA** lables. 
**Stage Two** built on the previous stage by adding resources to pull **JSON** from the server while making the response available offline by adding serviceworkers.
**Stage Three** further enhances the web application by allowing users to add reviews, implementing background sync while achieving top marks on Lighthouse audits.
